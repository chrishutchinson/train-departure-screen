# UK train departure screen

> Python script to display replica real-time UK railway station departure screens for SSD13xx devices

## Sample output

![Example output of the script](capture.png)

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need Python 3.6+.

### Raspbian

If you're using Raspbian Lite, you'll also need to install:

- `libopenjp2-7`

with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libopenjp2-7
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repo

2. Install dependencies

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Sign up for the [Realtime Trains API](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/), and generate a username and password

4. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` and complete the values, including your Realtime Trains API keys from step 3. _Note: station names should be provided as their three-letter station code, all available [here](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/48541.aspx)._

5. Start the app with:

```bash
$ python ./src/main.py --display pygame --width 256 --height 64
```

Change the `--display` flag to alter the output mechanism (a list of options can be found in this README: https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.examples). Use `capture` to save to images, and `pygame` to run a visual emulator.

Remember to pass `--interface spi` if you are using SPI to communicate with your screen. Otherwise, the default of `i2c` should suffice.

```bash
$ python ./src/main.py --display ssd1322 --width 256 --height 64 --interface spi
```

## Video demo

I've tweeted a video demo of the software running on a real device: https://twitter.com/chrishutchinson/status/1136743837244768257
